Mod Description

Safaricraft is a WIP mod aiming to add more mobs to enhance the Minecraft world. Mobs will be able to spawn naturally in different biomes, and this will allow both survival and creative players to construct their own zoos in Minecraft.

Safaricraft will likely have either a 1.10.2 version or a 1.12.1 version, or both depending on the coder's ability.

Team:
Lukamas233 ---coder
